overview: >-
  Lives all around the world have been dramatically impacted by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. The global research community has mobilized to respond with timely research and scientific analysis that can contribute to our understanding and management of the virus.    

  The ACL community can play a unique role in supporting research to combat COVID-19. Many valuable insights and information may be contained in vast quantities of text and speech data. We invite submissions related to any aspect of natural language processing (NLP) applied to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, in an open, rapid review format that will allow this active and late-breaking research to be shared and discussed.
