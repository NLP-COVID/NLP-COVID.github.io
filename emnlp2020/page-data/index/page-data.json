The global research community has mobilized to respond with timely research and scientific analysis that can contribute to our understanding and management of the virus.    \nThe ACL community can play a unique role in supporting research to combat COVID-19. Many valuable insights and information may be contained in vast quantities of text and speech data. We invite submissions related to any aspect of natural language processing (NLP) applied to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, in an open, rapid review format that will allow this active and late-breaking research to be shared and discussed.\nIn Part 1 of the workshop held at ACL 2020, we had an overwhelming response to the call for papers; through organizing \"Part 2\" we are enabling the review and sharing of that work.","extraInfo":["November 20, 2020 (08:00 - 21:00 London/UK time)"],"headerImage":{"image":"img/coronavirus.jpg","imageAlt":"Photo by Fusion Medical Animation on Unsplash"},"seo":{"browserTitle":"NLP COVID-19 Workshop (Part 2) @ EMNLP 2020","title":"NLP COVID-19","description":"The NLP COVID-19 Workshop (Part 2) at EMNLP 2020"},"newsItems":[{"date":"2020-11-16","text":"Please join the workshop on Friday online at [Virtual EMNLP](https://virtual.2020.emnlp.org/workshop_WS-26.html).
