The global research community has mobilized to respond with timely research and scientific analysis that can contribute to our understanding and management of the virus.    \n   \nThe ACL community can play a unique role in supporting research to combat COVID-19. Many valuable insights and information may be contained in vast quantities of text and speech data. We invite submissions related to any aspect of natural language processing (NLP) applied to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, in an open, rapid review format that will allow this active and late-breaking research to be shared and discussed.","extraInfo":["July 9-10, 2020"],"headerImage":{"image":"img/coronavirus.jpg","imageAlt":"Photo by Fusion Medical Animation on Unsplash"},"seo":{"browserTitle":"NLP COVID-19 Workshop @ ACL 2020","title":"NLP COVID-19","description":"The NLP COVID-19 Workshop at ACL 2020"},"newsItems":[{"date":"2020-07-08","text":"The [schedule](/schedule) of the workshop is now available!"},{"date":"2020-06-29","text":"To clarify the final submission deadline, it is the **[end of 30 June -- Anywhere on Earth](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20200701T115900&p1=tz_aoe&p2=tz_gmt)**"},{"date":"2020-06-29","text":"We have had quite a few submissions come in the last week and are expecting a number more ahead of the final submission deadline.
